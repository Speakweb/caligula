The KeyManager is a class that you will need to implement to handle public keys, you can use one of the existing library like crypto in nodeJS or any other library that you find suitable

And the PersistentStorage is a class that you will need to implement to handle storing URLs in a persistent storage like mongodb, firebase, etc.

    If the user does not submit a url for that day then save a record which says "url not submitted"
You can use a cron job or any other scheduling mechanism to check every day if a url is submitted or not and record it as "url not submitted"

Please note that this is a simplified example and does not include error handling or additional features such as displaying past URLs or allowing users to update their public keys.
